/**
 * When we need to steer in an LLM-based app, a common approach is to throw everything at the model: "here's all the
 * stuff you can do, here's what the user said, here's what you said before, etc, now give me a full plan of action."
 *
 * Whereas this approach is just focusing very narrowly on "pick a route", and only asking the model to emit a single
 * token.
 *
 * I suspect the former approach will be more robust and easier to program as models get more accurate, but I think this
 * approach will lead to more robustness today. I think with the former, it's still too likely that models will go off
 * the rails.
